Designing an efficient file compression algorithm involves selecting a suitable data structure and optimizing the compression and decompression processes. One commonly used data structure for file compression is the Huffman coding algorithm.

Huffman Coding:
Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding technique that assigns shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters or patterns in a file. \It creates a binary tree where each leaf node represents a character or pattern and the path from the root to each leaf node represents the code for that character or pattern.

The compression process using Huffman coding involves the following steps:

Frequency analysis: Analyze the input file to determine the frequency of occurrence of each character or pattern.

Build a Huffman tree: Create a binary tree where each leaf node contains a character or pattern and its associated frequency. 
The tree is built by repeatedly combining the two nodes with the lowest frequencies into a new internal node until all nodes are combined.

Generate codes: Traverse the Huffman tree to assign unique binary codes to each leaf node. Codes are generated by assigning a '0' for each 
left branch and a '1' for each right branch in the tree.

Replace characters with codes: Replace each character in the input file with its corresponding Huffman code.

Store the Huffman tree: Store the generated Huffman tree structure along with the compressed data to ensure proper decompression.

The decompression process involves reversing the compression steps:

Read the Huffman tree: Retrieve the stored Huffman tree structure.

Decode the compressed data: Read the compressed data and traverse the Huffman tree to decode the binary codes back into characters or patterns.

Trade-offs between Compression Ratio and Time Complexity:
There is often a trade-off between achieving a higher compression ratio (smaller file size) and the time complexity of the compression and decompression 
algorithms. More sophisticated compression algorithms may achieve higher compression ratios but require more time to compress and decompress files.

To improve the compression ratio, more advanced algorithms like Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) or Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) can be considered. 
These algorithms often involve more complex data structures and more intricate compression techniques, which can result in higher time complexity.

On the other hand, if time complexity is a significant concern, simpler compression algorithms like Run-Length Encoding (RLE) or basic Huffman 
coding can be used. These algorithms may have lower compression ratios but are faster to compress and decompress files.

Solution - Compression Algorithm Implementation:

Here's an implementation of a basic Huffman coding compression algorithm in Python:

from heapq import heappop, heappush
from collections import Counter
import os


# Node class for the Huffman tree
class Node:
    def __init__(self, frequency, character=None, left=None, right=None):
        self.frequency = frequency
        self.character = character
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


# Function to build the Huffman tree
def build_huffman_tree(frequencies):
    heap = [[frequency, Node(frequency, char)] for char, frequency in frequencies.items()]
    heapify(heap)

    while len(heap) > 1:
        lo = heappop(heap)
        hi = heappop(heap)
        combined_frequency = lo[0] + hi[0]
        combined_node = Node(combined_frequency, left=lo[1], right=hi[1])
        heappush(heap, [combined_frequency, combined_node])

    return heap[0][1]


# Function to generate Huffman codes
def generate_huffman_codes(node, current_code="", codes={}):
    if node.character:
        codes[node.character] = current_code
        return codes

    codes = generate_huffman_codes(node.left, current_code + "0", codes)
    codes = generate_huffman_codes(node.right, current_code + "1", codes)
    return codes


# Function to compress a file using Huffman coding
def compress_file(input_file, output_file):
    # Step 1: Frequency analysis
    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
        frequencies = Counter(data)

    # Step 2: Build Huffman tree
    huffman_tree = build_huffman_tree(frequencies)

    # Step 3: Generate Huffman codes
    huffman_codes = generate_huffman_codes(huffman_tree)

    # Step 4: Replace characters with codes and write compressed data
    compressed_data = ''.join(huffman_codes[char] for char in data)
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as file:
        # Write the Huffman tree structure to the beginning of the file
        pickle.dump(huffman_tree, file)
        # Write the compressed data
        file.write(compressed_data.encode('utf-8'))


# Function to decompress a file using Huffman coding
def decompress_file(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as file:
        # Read the Huffman tree structure from the file
        huffman_tree = pickle.load(file)
        # Read the compressed data
        compressed_data = file.read().decode('utf-8')

    # Step 2: Decode the compressed data
    current_node = huffman_tree
    decompressed_data = ""
    for bit in compressed_data:
        if bit == '0':
            current_node = current_node.left
        else:
            current_node = current_node.right

        if current_node.character:
            decompressed_data += current_node.character
            current_node = huffman_tree

    # Step 3: Write the decompressed data to the output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        file.write(decompressed_data)


# Example usage
input_file = 'input.txt'
compressed_file = 'compressed.bin'
decompressed_file = 'decompressed.txt'

compress_file(input_file, compressed_file)
decompress_file(compressed_file, decompressed_file)


Time Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the compression algorithm depends on the number of unique characters or patterns in the input 
Let's denote this number as "n."

Frequency analysis: O(n)
Building the Huffman tree: O(n log n) using a binary heap.
Generating Huffman codes: O(n) since each character or pattern needs to be visited once.
Replacing characters with codes: O(n) to iterate through the input file and replace each character with its corresponding Huffman code.
Writing the compressed data: O(n) to write the compressed data to the output file.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the compression algorithm is O(n log n), where "n" is the number of unique characters or patterns 
in the input file.

Possible Enhancements:

Advanced Compression Algorithms: Consider implementing more advanced compression algorithms like LZW or BWT to achieve better 
compression ratios at the cost of increased time complexity.

Multithreading: Utilize multiple threads to parallelize the compression and decompression processes, especially during frequency analysis and encoding. 
This can improve overall performance on multi-core systems.

File Chunking: Instead of compressing the entire file at once, consider dividing it into smaller chunks and compressing each chunk separately. 
This approach can provide better responsiveness and enable parallel processing of individual chunks.

Dictionary Optimization: Fine-tune the dictionary used for compression to improve its efficiency in handling specific file types or data patterns.

Adaptive Compression: Implement adaptive compression techniques that dynamically update the compression model based on the characteristics of the input data.
 This approach can lead to better compression ratios for diverse types
